# KS0487 Keyestudio 37 in 1 Sensor Kit v3.0

![](media/ks0487.jpg)

## 1.Introduction

This is an era of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is widely
applied to our lives, especially for all kinds of robots. In the first place we
need to learn the basic working principle.

The microcontroller is equivalent to the brain of the robot. The various sensors
installed on robots are their eyes, noses, mouths, ears and so on. To make
beginners understand principle readily, Keyestudio has released this sensor kit,
including digital and analog sensors, modules such as ultrasound, digital tubes,
temperature and humidity sensor. In addition, we provide detailed connection
diagram and sample code for each module.

All sample codes are based on ARDUINO. Also, you have other alternatives
development platforms such as 51, STM32, Raspberry Pi and micro:bit, as the
working principle of those platforms is almost same.

Note: the port “-, +, S” on sensors or modules correspond to “G, V, S” due to
the change of edition.

In addition, some reed switches are also equipped with another reed acting as the third normally-closed contact. These reed contacts are encapsulated in a glass tube fulled of inert gases(such as nitrogen and helium) or in a vacuum glass tube. The reeds encapsulated in the glass tube are placed in parallel with ends overlapped. Certain amount of space or mutual contact will be reserved to constitute the normally-open or normally-closed contacts of the switch.

Reed switch can be used as for count, limit or other purposes. For instance, a kind of bike-kilometer is constituted by sticking magnetic to the tire and mounting reed switch aside. You can also mount reed switch on the door for alarming purpose or as switches. Reed switch has been widely applied in household appliances, cars, communication, industry, healthcare and security areas. Furthermore, it can also be applied to other sensors and electric devices such as liquidometer, door magnet, reed relay, oil level sensor and proximity sensor(magnetic sensor). It can be used under high-risk environment.

Project 19: Analog Temperature

[![](media/09522ffb881f963bc930e1f1001809e5.png)](https://wiki.keyestudio.com/File:KS0349_19-1.png)

Description:  
This module is based on the working principle of a thermistor (resistance varies with temperature change in the environment). It can sense temperature changes in the surrounding and send the data to the analog IO of Arduino board. All we need to do is to convert the sensor’s output data into degrees Celsius temperature via simple programming, finally displaying it on the monitor. It's both convenient and effective, thus it is widely applied to gardening, home alarm system and other devices.

}
// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop()
{ int sensorValue = analogRead(A0);
    Serial.println(sensorValue);
    delay(1);
}
```
The above code is only for analog value. You can see that the analog value is changing according to the temperature change in the environment. But it’s not very obvious. Let’s solve this by using the following equation. Then upload the code below to the Arduino board. The value read from the serial port is similar to normal temperature. eg. The temperature right now is 30°C.  
```c++
#include <math.h>
void setup()
{
    Serial.begin(9600);
}
void loop()
{
    double val = analogRead(0);
    double fenya = (val / 1023) * 5;
    double r = (5 - fenya) / fenya * 4700;
    Serial.println( 1 / (
    log(r / 10000) / 3950 + 1 / (25 + 273.15)) - 273.15);
    delay(1000);
}

Project 27: Voltage Detection

[![](media/13b62e9ad88fb55d228fffd38c7e6811.png)](https://wiki.keyestudio.com/File:KS0349_29-1.png)

Description:  
Since the electronic products are various, the voltage of the power supply is also different. It is indeed necessary to detect it with a suitable voltage detection module or controller. The maximum input voltage of the controller’s analog interface is 5V, which means that the voltage greater than 5V will not be detected. However, this voltage detection module canachieve to detect the voltagegreater than 5 V. It is designed on the basis of resistive voltage divider principle, which can make the input voltage of bindingpost interface narrow 5 times, and the analog input voltage is up to 5 V, thus the input voltage of voltage detection module is not greater than 5V * 5 = 25 V (if using 3.3 V system, the input voltage is not greater than 3.3 V*5 = 16.5 V). The AVR chip is 10-bit AD, so the analog resolution of this module is 0.00489V (5V / 1023), and the minimum input voltage is 0.00489V * 5 = 0.02445 V. When connect this sensor to expansion board using 3Pinwire, it can not only easily detect the magnitude of the voltage power and monitor the electric quantity of battery for interactive media works or robot, but also can combine with IICLCD1602 LCD module to display the voltage or make a voltage monitor.  

Parameters: 
Working voltage: 0V-25VDC  
Signal type: analog signal  
Size: 35\*20\*14mm

Description:    
IR transmitter module is designed for IR communication, which is widely used for operating the television device from a short line-of-sight distance. Since infrared (IR) remote control uses light, it requires line of sight to operate the destination device. The signal can, however, be reflected by mirrors, just like any other light sources. Infrared receivers also tend to have a more or less limited operating angle, which mainly depends on the optical characteristics of the phototransistor. However, it’s easy to increase the operating angle using a matte transparent object in front of the receiver.  

Specification:  
Power Supply: 3-5V  
Infrared center frequency: 850nm-940nm  
Infrared emission angle: about 20degrees

Project 36: Ultrasonic Ranger

![](media/d2fbcc3559c5b046f0a63eee4ebaec6f.png)  

Description:  
As the ultrasonic has strong directivity, slow energy consumption and far spread distance in the media, so it is commonly used in the measurement of distance, such as range finder and position measuring instrument. Using ultrasonic is more rapid, convenient, simple to calculate and more easier to achieve real-time control, so it has also been widely used in the development of mobile robots. Ultrasonic detector module can provide 2cm-450cm non-contact sensing distance, and its ranging accuracy is up to 3mm, very good to meet the normal requirements. The module includes an ultrasonic transmitter and receiver as well as the corresponding control circuit.  

Working Schematics:  
Please refer to the working sequence as below：  
[![](media/6afd87b7882d5ca7eaaf01ef98889c88.png)](https://wiki.keyestudio.com/File:Ks0349-46-1.png)

1. First pull down the TRIG, and then trigger it with at least 10us high level signal;   
2. After triggering, the module will automatically transmit eight 40KHZ square waves, and automatically detect whether there is a pulse signal back.    
3. If there is a signal back, through the ECHO to output a high level, the duration time of high level is actually the time from sending ultrasonic to returning back.    

Test distance = high level duration \* velocity of sound (340m/s) \* 0.5  

Parameters:
1. Working voltage：0.5V(DC)
2. Working current：15mA
3. Detecting range：2-450cm
4. Detecting angle：15 degrees
5. Input trigger pulse：10us TTL Level
6. Output echo signal： output TTL level signal(HIGH)，proportional to range.

[![](media/5fc0062b126e990682444b76b6c8f732.png)](https://wiki.keyestudio.com/File:Ks0349-46-3.png)

After connecting well, you can use it to measure the distance, displaying the distance value on the monitor.    

Test Code:  
Copy and paste the test code below to Arduino software.    
```c++
int inputPin = 4; // define ultrasonic signal receiver pin ECHO to D4
int outputPin = 5; // define ultrasonic signal transmitter pin TRIG to D5
void setup()
{
    Serial.begin(9600);
    pinMode(inputPin, INPUT);
    pinMode(outputPin, OUTPUT);
}
void loop()
{
    digitalWrite(outputPin, LOW); delayMicroseconds(2);
    digitalWrite(outputPin, HIGH); // Pulse for 10μ s to trigger ultrasonic detection
    delayMicroseconds(10);
    digitalWrite(outputPin, LOW);
    int distance = pulseIn(inputPin, HIGH); // Read receiver pulse time
    distance = distance / 58; // Transform pulse time to distance
    Serial.println(distance); //Output distance
    delay(50);
}
```
